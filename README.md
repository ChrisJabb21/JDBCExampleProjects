Java applications for past assignments with JDBC, SQL starter scripts, backend properties files, and DAO implementations. The database used was an MySQL RDS environment which has been offline. One is World application and the other is related to customer information.

I provided sql script files with SQL commands used to create the MySQL database and its tables for each project.
